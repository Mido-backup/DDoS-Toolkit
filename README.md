DDoS Toolkit

A simple and lightweight HTTP Flood DDoS attack tool written in Python. This tool is designed to simulate a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on a target URL by sending multiple HTTP requests, which may overload the server. It is intended **only for educational purposes**. Use this tool responsibly and always have permission from the target server owner.

## üö® **Warning: Ethical Use Only**
This tool is designed for **ethical** testing, security research, and educational purposes. Unauthorized use on websites or servers without explicit permission is **illegal** and can result in criminal charges. Always ensure that you have proper authorization before running the tool on any server or website.

## üìã Features

- **HTTP Flood Simulation**: Sends multiple HTTP requests to a target URL in quick succession.
- **Multi-threaded Requests**: Distribute the requests across multiple threads to simulate a larger-scale attack.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust the number of threads and pause time between requests.
- **Real-Time Attack Status**: Displays the number of requests sent in real-time.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Allows users to stop the attack with a `KeyboardInterrupt`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with this tool, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ddos-toolkit.git
cd ddos-toolkit

2. Install the Required Dependencies

Install the necessary Python dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install:

    requests for sending HTTP requests
    colorama for colored output

3. Python 3.x Requirement

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can check the version with:

python --version

‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can launch the attack using the following command:

python3 ddos.py -u http://example.com 

Command-Line Arguments:

    -u or --url: Required. The target URL (e.g., http://example.com).
    -t or --threads: Optional. The number of threads to use for the attack. Default is 10.
    -p or --pause: Optional. The time in seconds to pause between requests. Default is 0.1 seconds.

Example:

python3 attack_script.py -u http://example.com -t 20 -p 0.5

This command will send requests to http://example.com with 20 threads and a 0.5-second pause between each request.
üíª Example Usage Script

If you want to automate the attack or integrate it into a larger project, you can use the following example shell script to run the attack:

# example_attack.txt

#!/bin/bash

URL="http://example.com"
THREADS=20
PAUSE_TIME=0.1

python3 ddos.py -u $URL -t $THREADS -p $PAUSE_TIME

üìä Real-Time Status Reporting

While the attack is running, the script will show the number of requests sent in real-time. The status will be updated every second and displayed on the console.

Example output:

Requests Sent: 1000
Requests Sent: 2000
Requests Sent: 3000
